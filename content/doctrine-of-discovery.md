The Doctrine of Discovery refers to a set of fifteenth-century papal pronouncements and European legal-theological ideas that granted Christian monarchies the claimed right to "discover," claim, and govern lands inhabited by non-Christians, treating Indigenous peoples as subjects to be converted, displaced, or dominated. Framed through concepts such as *terra nullius*---the fiction that lands were "empty" if not ruled by Christians---the doctrine sanctified colonial expansion and resource extraction as lawful and divinely authorized. Over time, these ideas were embedded in imperial and national legal systems, shaping property law, sovereignty claims, and policies toward Indigenous nations. Its legacy endures in court decisions, state practices, and global power relations, where the doctrine continues to influence land rights, political authority, and the ongoing struggles of Indigenous peoples for self-determination, recognition, and justice.
