## Project Overview

The Memories for the Future Finding Aid is a comprehensive digital resource that provides access to and context for the American Indian Law Alliance (AILA) archives. This project emerged from the need to preserve, organize, and share decades of invaluable documentation related to Indigenous peoples' advocacy at the United Nations, grassroots organizing, and the fight for Native rights and sovereignty. By creating this finding aid, we aim to make these critical historical materials accessible to researchers, community members, educators, and activists who continue the work of advancing Indigenous rights and self-determination.

## Purpose and Goals

This finding aid serves multiple purposes within the broader archival mission. It provides detailed descriptions of collection materials, including correspondence, reports, photographs, audio-visual materials, and organizational records that document AILA's work from its founding to the present day. The guide helps users understand the scope and content of available materials, locate specific documents or topics of interest, and contextualize these resources within the larger historical narrative of Indigenous rights movements. Our goal is to ensure that these memories of the past inform and inspire future generations of advocates, scholars, and community leaders.

## Who This Guide Serves

We designed this finding aid with diverse audiences in mind. Researchers and scholars will find detailed archival descriptions and metadata to support academic inquiry into Indigenous rights history, international law, and social movements. Educators can use this resource to develop curricula and teaching materials that center Indigenous perspectives and histories. Community members and tribal nations can access documentation of their own advocacy and organizing efforts. Activists and advocates will discover historical precedents and strategies that inform contemporary struggles for sovereignty and justice. The guide is structured to be accessible to both archival experts and those new to working with primary source materials.

## Methodology and Development

The development of this finding aid involved extensive collaboration between archivists, community members, and the AILA team. We employed archival standards and best practices while remaining responsive to Indigenous protocols for handling sensitive materials and cultural knowledge. The project included surveying and appraising collection materials, creating detailed descriptive metadata, digitizing key documents and media, and building a user-friendly digital interface. Throughout this process, we prioritized community input and ensured that the organization and description of materials reflected Indigenous perspectives and priorities rather than imposing external categorizations.

## Future Directions

This finding aid represents a living resource that will continue to grow and evolve. As we process additional archival materials, digitize more content, and incorporate community feedback, the guide will expand to encompass new collections and enhanced access points. We are committed to ongoing improvements in accessibility, including adding more multilingual descriptions, enhancing search functionality, and developing educational resources that accompany the archival materials. We invite users to share their experiences, suggest improvements, and help us build a resource that truly serves the needs of those working toward Indigenous justice and sovereignty.
