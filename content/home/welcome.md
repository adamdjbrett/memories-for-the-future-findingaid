## Centering Indigenous Sovereignty
The American Indian Law Alliance (AILA) partners with Indigenous nations and communities to advance sovereignty, protect treaties, and uphold human rights. This site curates research, legal resources, and educational materials so advocates can quickly find and share what they need.

## Building Research Pathways
Here you'll find guidance on documenting community knowledge, organizing archives, and leveraging digital tools to preserve stories for future generations. We spotlight collaborations, case studies, and open-source resources that lower barriers to building and maintaining research collections.

## How to Get Involved
Whether you're beginning a new project or expanding an existing archive, explore the collections, contribute materials, or reach out to the AILA team. Together we can strengthen networks of support, keep knowledge accessible, and ensure these narratives remain visible and actionable.
